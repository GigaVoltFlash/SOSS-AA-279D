        & \tabitem Updated problem set 1:  clarified which ROEs are being used when throughout the project \\
        & \tabitem Updated problem set 2:
        consolidated some repeated equations, updated RTN projection plot for readability, added new RTN projection plot to showcase effects of maneuver, added supportive descriptions \\
        & \tabitem Updated/fixed problem set 3: updated ROEs to match those picked in later psets, fixed geometric linear mapping so that it is more accurate than YA solution, created more readable figures, improved overall readability (spelling and grammar fixes) \\
        & \tabitem Updated problem set 4: included clarification over the usage of given ROEs versus customer ROEs, improved language and reasoning about drifts observed in some ROEs \\
        & \tabitem Updated problem set 5: \\
        & \tabitem Updated problem set 6: added a missing negative sign in the equation for drift in $\delta \lambda$, fixed calculation and plotting of delta-v's for Lyapunov control so that they are much more reasonable and closer to delta-v lower bound \\
