\section{Appendix: Code}


Code is available at our GitHub: \href{https://github.com/GigaVoltFlash/279D_Project}{https://github.com/GigaVoltFlash/279D\_Project}.

Refer to \href{https://github.com/GigaVoltFlash/279D_Project/blob/main/sim/sim_main.m}{sim\_main.m} as the main file where we run our sim.

There is a separate folder \href{https://github.com/GigaVoltFlash/279D_Project/blob/main/gnc}{for GNC} where we store all the files relevant to control methods are modes.
