\section{Problem Set 8}

In this section, we go over the implementation of our Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based on our prior description of the system architecture, provided in Section \ref{sec:7}. 

\subsection{Ground Truth Propagator}

Using GVEs, provide equations (or refer to existing equations)

\subsection{Generating Measurements}

ECI and RTN are calculated from OE, and then we add Gaussian noise. Define amounts.

\subsection{Initializing Estimate Mean and Covariance}

We initialize the initial mean $\mu_0$ and the initial covariance $\Sigma_0$ in the following manner...

\subsection{EKF Implementation and Choice of Q and R}

EKF algorithm given below.

Q and R chosen to be the following values.

\subsection{EKF Results and Analysis}
